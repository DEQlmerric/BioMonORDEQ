GitHub-R workflow

1. Open the BioMonORDEQ R project file from C:\Users\<username>\Documents\BioMonORDEQ
2. In the Git tab, PULL to incorporate all edits/ensure you're working off the most recent versions
3. Make edits to a script and save changes (file will turn blue in Git window)
4. Click on the "staged" box next to the modified script and COMMIT changes (and record comment)
5. PUSH the updated version back to Git
